# Recurrent Context Compression: Efficiently Expanding the Context Window of LLM
[[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06110)]


## TL;DR
This work introduces a method called Recurrent Context Compression (RCC), designed to efficiently expand the context window length of LLMs within constrained storage space. We have released a model based pythia-1.4b with 32x context compression. Specifically, this model can compress the input text to 1/32 of its original size, significantly reducing memory consumption for long sequences. 

Due to the limitations of the fine-tuning dataset, the model currently only supports QA tasks



## News

- [2024/6/9] We released the RCC-Pythia-1.4b [model](https://huggingface.co/fcyp) and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06110)

## Model Overview
RCC employs an encoder-decoder framework, with both the encoder and decoder weights initialized from a large language model. The trained encoder compresses fixed-length context information into a more compact form, applicable to both instructions and regular text. When context exceeds the fixed length, the encoder performs cyclic compression and concatenates all compressed feature vectors. The decoder uses these compressed vectors as input for final text generation.

We also addressed the issue of poor model performance when both instructions and context are compressed in downstream tasks, proposing an instruction reconstruction method to mitigate this. For more details, please refer to our paper.

## FAQ

1. **How long can RCC extend the base modelÔºü**
The final theoretical sequence length is determined by the product of the decoder‚Äôs compression rate and the encoder‚Äôs window length. For instance, if the compression rate is set to 32 and the encoder is designed to handle 2048 tokens, the resulting theoretical length would be 32 times 2048.

2. **How effective is RCC so far?**
Due to the length constraints of the fine-tuning dataset, when performing inference with sequences longer than the length of the fine-tuning dataset, the model‚Äôs performance may degrade.


## TODOs
We will also continue to train and release RCC models based on stronger open-source models, including the qwen2 series, llama3 series, and mistral series.

**Please stay tuned for our updates.**

## Motivation
Our encoder design is inspired by the Mamba-based LLM. Mamba is essentially a state space model, similar to an RNN. In Mamba, the current token only needs to access the state vector from the previous timestep to complete the current inference step. However, as the context length increases, the performance of Mamba deteriorates. This indicates that the state vector at each timestep in Mamba can store only a limited length of historical context information. Therefore, we propose a compromise: for long sequences, we can divide them into fixed-length short sequences and iteratively compress each short sequence into a state vector. We concatenate the state vectors of each short sequence as the historical state information during inference. This approach maximizes the retention of complete historical information while leveraging the model‚Äôs compression capabilities to save memory. In this paper, we use compression rate to reflect the maximum context length that a state vector at each timestep can store. Our experiments show that Transformers also have this capability because a Transformer can be viewed as a special state space model or RNN. 
For the decoder, we use a Transformer, allowing access to compressed vectors at any position.
