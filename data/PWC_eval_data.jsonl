{"input": "French senior civil servant arrested on suspicion of spying for North Korea\n\nNovember 27, 2018 by Joseph Fitsanakis\n\nA senior civil servant in the upper house of the French parliament has been arrested on suspicion of spying for North Korea, according to prosecutors. The news of the suspected spy’s arrest was first reported on Monday by Quotidien, a daily politics and culture show on the Monaco-based television channel TMC. The show cited “a judicial source in Paris” and said that France’s domestic security and counterintelligence agency, the General Directorate for Internal Security (DGSI), was in charge of the espionage case.\n\nThe senior administrator has been identified as Benoit Quennedey, a civil servant who liaises between the French Senate and the Department of Architecture and Heritage, which operates under France’s Ministry of Culture. Quennedey was reportedly detained on Sunday morning and his office in the French Senate was raided by DGSI officers on the same day. Quotidien said that he was arrested on suspicion of “collecting and delivering to a foreign power information likely to subvert core national interests”. The report did not provide specific information about the type of information that Quennedey is believed to have passed to North Korea. It did state, however, that a counterintelligence investigation into his activities began in March of this year.\n\nQuennedey is believed to be the president of the Franco-Korean Friendship Association, the French branch of a Spanish-based organization that lobbies in favor of international support for North Korea. Korea Friendship Association branches exist in over 30 countries and are believed to be officially sanctioned by Pyongyang. They operate as something akin to the pre-World War II Comintern (Communist International), a Moscow-sanctioned international pressure group that advocated in favor of Soviet-style communism around the world. French media reported on Monday that Quennedey traveled extensively to the Korean Peninsula in the past decade and has written a French-language book on North Korea. News reports said that the French President Emmanuel Macron had been made aware of Quennedey’s arrest. The senior civil servant faces up to 30 years in prison if found guilty of espionage.\n\n► Author: Joseph Fitsanakis | Date: 27 November 2018 | Permalink\n\n", "prompt": "Identify the person arrested on suspicion of spying for North Korea.", "answer": "Benoit Quennedey"}

She is “deprived of any meaningful human contact or sensory stimulation for 22 hours a day, every day, with no release date in sight.”\n\nButina is accused of acting as an unregistered Russian agent, working to influence U.S. politics by making connections with American officials and trying to affect policy.\n\nHer motion states that she had been in solitary for 67 straight days before being placed in gen-pop after multiple requests by her lawyers, but she was put back into solitary on November 21. According to the motion, this came after corrections staff said Butina had put another inmate in touch with her lawyers, “but staff did not find a disciplinary violation—major or minor.” Personnel later said she was moved “for her safety,” but Butina’s lawyers claim this was “a ruse to shield review of arbitrary conduct.”\n\nButina’s attorneys say they reached out to authorities for information, but have yet to get any explanation for why she was placed back in solitary.

{"input": "Craig F. Walker | Boston Globe | Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration is making good on its latest effort to lower out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients, but its approach could also limit drug options or even risk eliminating coverage of some prescriptions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed late Monday changes to Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D. Among the changes, it would allow insurers to stop covering certain \"protected\" classes of drugs used to treat common ailments like depression, cancer and HIV. When Congress added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare in 2003, it required insurers to cover at least two different drugs to treat any particular ailment. It also set aside six protected classes of medication where insurers were required to cover \"all or substantially all\" of the drugs offered to ensure seniors got whatever treatment they needed, like for cancer. The Trump administration thinks that gives drug manufacturers greater negotiating power on prices. The proposal is meant to give insurers more leverage and drive prices down by allowing them to drop coverage of certain drugs in a protected class if it's too expensive.\n\n\"The concern however is people lose access to specific medications\" because plans stop providing them, Juliette Cubanski, associate director of the Program on Medicare Policy at Kaiser Family Foundation, told CNBC. \"And that concern is outweighed by any potential savings.\" The Medicare program under former President Barack Obama attempted a similar proposal back in 2014 but it was ultimately abandoned after public backlash and criticism that it could lower seniors' access to necessary drugs. The current proposal, which is open for public comment until Jan. 25, would still require insurers to cover at least two drugs in every therapeutic category. But they could exclude some protected-class drugs when prices increase faster than the rate of inflation or when new drug formulations \"are not a significant innovation over the original product,\" according to Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Seema Verma. Pharmaceutical companies \"have been able to say you have to cover my drug no matter what and have to pay whatever I want on my plan,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" That ends under this proposal, he said. Spending on Medicare Part D drugs totaled $137 billion in 2015, according to Kaiser.

His unique ability is called The Raven King, and lets levied units gain additional combat and movement strength, level up without the need for gold and resources, and awards two additional envoys if the levied soldier is from a City-State.\n\nMeanwhile, Hungary’s unique ability is called Pearl of the Danube, which makes districts and buildings constructed across a river from the city center get built faster. This is an interesting ability because it encourages players to build around rivers, even with the increased likelihood of flooding in Gathering Storm. Hungary’s unique building is the Thermal Bath, something Hungary is known for in real life. This building grants more amenities and production to nearby city centers and replaces the zoo.\n\nWhen it comes to new units, Hungary has the Huszár and the Black Army. The Huszár is a light cavalry unit that can be built during the Industrial era and is bolstered with every additional alliance the player has. As for the Black Army, they can be constructed when The Raven King is active after Castle technology has been researched and will become stronger when place next to levied units.

{"input": "Icelanders are big on candy, which you‘ve probably noticed if you‘ve ever been to Iceland and one of its many grocery stores. One of Must See‘s favorite candy is the Omnom chocolate – something you‘ve also noticed if you‘ve read some of our blogs.\n\nThat is why we are so happy for Omnom because recently their milk chocolate, Milk of Nicaragua, got a gold prize as the world‘s best milk chocolate at the 2018 International Chocolate Awards. And the competition was fierce! We‘re talking about Svenska Kakaobolaget from Sweden, Friis-Holm from Denmark, Franceschi Chocolate from Venezuela and Soma Chocolatemaker from Canada were among other competitiors.\n\nSee also: Enjoy Icelandic Candy Via Candy Exchange.\n\nAnd if that wasn‘t enough, Omnom managed to snatch four other gold medals, two silvers and three bronze awards at the International Chocolate Awards.\n\nOmnom specializes in bean to bar chocolate, just like world famous chocolate makers Barry Callebaut, Fazer, Ghirardelli and Valrhona to name a few. In short – Omnom focuses on quality, making chocolate in a small factory close to down town Reykjavík.\n\n„Five years ago, when we started Omnom, we never thought we would win an award for the best milk chocolate. It has been part of our quality policy to only use the best, possible ingredients at any given time,“ says chocolatier Kjartan Gíslason, one of the founders of Omnom in a press release from the company.\n\nSure, Omnom chocolate is more expensive than the other chocolate brands in Iceland, but if you take time and take the chocolate factory tour you will see why. There is so much work and passion that goes into a single candy bar and the taste is out of this world. We really can‘t find enough good words to say about Omnom and we highly recommend you at least try a piece of Omnom when in Iceland. You won‘t regret it.\n\nCongratulations to Omnom, and to Iceland in fact.

{"input": "A groundbreaking Aboriginal community-led justice reinvestment program to address the underlying causes of crime delivered a saving of almost $3m to the far western New South Wales town of Bourke last year.\n\nA KMPG report has also found that the initiative could deliver an additional economic impact of $7m over the next five years.\n\nMaranguka justice reinvestment is based on the idea that savings can be made through redirecting funding spent on policing and punishment to projects that help prevent offending behaviour.\n\nKPMG calculated the savings based on the reduced number of police hours taken up with responding to domestic violence incidents and other serious offences, the reduced daily cost of imprisonment, as well as fewer bail breaches, fines and other penalties in the region. It also accounted for the reduced number of Centrelink crisis payments, fewer days absent from work and school, and reduced court costs for police and defendants.\n\n“Maranguka is a recognition that we in Australia continue to spend far too much on the end product rather than deal with the upfront,” the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said in launching the report.\n\n“I don’t share the views of some of my colleagues that imposing views from the top will ever actually be the solution,” he said.\n\n“The solution has to be empowerment of those who hold their futures in their own hands. This is a local community exercise.\n\n“Each community knows they have their own set of factors. There isn’t one answer for everybody. But the empowerment of locals to drive their own changes is something that governments of either political persuasion can support.”\n\nOf the $3.1m economic impact in 2017, KPMG said two-thirds were savings in the justice system and one-third was the broader economic benefit to the region.\n\nThe report found:\n\na 23% reduction in police-recorded incidence of domestic violence and comparable drops in rates of reoffending;\n\na 31% increase in year 12 student retention rates and a 38% reduction in charges across the top five juvenile offence categories;\n\na 42% reduction in days spent in custody for adults.\n\n“There is no silver bullet here. The challenge is complex and ongoing,” the chair of Just Reinvest NSW, Sarah Hopkins, said.\n\n“What we know is that the community is doing its part. After decades of feeling let down, the community is starting to see the benefits of being part of the decision-making in Bourke,” she said. “There is a resilience around a long-term change process.”\n\n", "prompt": "Write a title for the above text.", "answer": "Aboriginal Community-Led Maranguka Program Saves Millions and Reduces Crime in Bourke"}
{"input": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, staunchly denied ever meeting with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on Tuesday, after the Guardian newspaper published a story alleging the two met at least three times, including once in 2016.\n\n“This story is totally false and deliberately libelous. I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,” Manafort said through a spokesman. “We are considering all legal options against the Guardian, who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it was false.”\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Guardian said the “story relied on a number of sources. We put these allegations to both Paul Manafort and Julian Assange’s representatives prior to publication. Neither responded to deny the visits taking place. We have since updated the story to reflect their denials.”\n\nManafort’s statement came one day after Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office told a federal judge that Manafort had breached his plea agreement by lying repeatedly to the FBI despite pledging to cooperate with the probe.\n\nIn the same court filing, Manafort denied lying, but both sides agreed the court should move ahead and set a date to sentence him for his crimes.\n\nProsecutors said they plan to file a report before sentencing laying out the alleged crimes Manafort committed after pleading guilty in September.\n\nThe surprise development came as Mueller is working toward finalizing a report on his probe into whether Russia and Trump’s campaign colluded in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nPart of that probe has involved looking into whether any of Trump’s associates may have had advance notice before WikiLeaks published emails stolen by Russian hackers from Democratic computer networks to damage Trump rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn recent months, Mueller’s team has subpoenaed associates of Trump’s political adviser and Manafort’s former business partner, Roger Stone, who has denied having access to the emails.\n\nIn the Guardian's story bit.ly/2DMIQkT published on Tuesday, the paper reported that Manafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London in 2013, 2015 and March 2016 - before the damaging emails were released months later.\n\nWikiLeaks also denounced the story on Twitter on Tuesday, saying it was “willing to bet the Guardian a million dollars and its editor’s head that Manafort never met Assange.”\n\nWikiLeaks also said that it has launched a legal fund to sue the newspaper for publishing a “fabricated story.”\n\n", "prompt": "What was the Guardian's defense of their story?", "answer": "The Guardian said their story relied on a number of sources and that they had put the allegations to both Paul Manafort and Julian Assange's representatives prior to publication.

The social media platform has come under fire for being a conduit in the spread of misinformation and for outside companies, such as Cambridge Analytica, gaining access to users’ data.\n\nThe company has recently been dealing with the fallout from reports that it hired a public relations firm to do opposition research on critics, including billionaire philanthropist George Soros.\n\n", "prompt": "Did Facebook's press office respond to the situation?
