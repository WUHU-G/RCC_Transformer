### PWC_eval_data.jsonl is a sample of test data that we extracted from the [PwC](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sggetao/PwC) test set.

### icae is a work similar to ours that you might be interested in reading. You can check out their paper [ICAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06945).

### We would like to thank ICAE for their open-source dataset and method.
